# TakeStock - Stock Analysis Platform

A web-based stock analysis platform that provides comprehensive stock information, historical pricing data, and business intelligence insights for informed investment decisions.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Real Data Only - No Mock/Simulated Data

**This application uses ONLY real-time data from financial APIs.** There is no mock, simulated, or generated data. The application uses a multi-API strategy:
- **Finnhub**: Real-time stock quotes and company profiles
- **Alpha Vantage**: 90-day historical price data (primary)
- **Polygon.io**: 90-day historical price data (backup)

If APIs are unavailable or return errors, the application will display error messages rather than showing fabricated data. This ensures you never make financial decisions based on inaccurate information.
