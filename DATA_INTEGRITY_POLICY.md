# Data Integrity Policy - TakeStock Application

## Last Updated: October 2, 2025

## Our Commitment: Real Data Only

TakeStock is committed to **never displaying mock, simulated, or generated financial data**. We understand that financial decisions must be based on accurate, real-time information, and that showing fabricated data could lead to poor investment decisions and financial losses.

## What We Changed

### ❌ REMOVED: All Mock/Simulated Data
1. **Deleted `getMockStockData()` function** - Previously used to generate fake stock prices
2. **Removed historical data generation** - Previously simulated 90-day charts when API failed
3. **Eliminated all fallback data** - No more "realistic" but fabricated price trends
4. **Removed demo mode** - Application now requires valid API access to function

### ✅ IMPLEMENTED: Strict Real-Data Policy
1. **API-Only Data**: All information comes directly from Finnhub API
2. **Fail Fast**: If API data is unavailable, show clear error messages
3. **No Fallbacks**: Never substitute real data with simulated data
4. **Transparent Errors**: Users see exactly what went wrong and why

## Current Behavior

### When You Have Valid API Access:
- ✅ Real-time stock prices from Finnhub
- ✅ Actual company information and descriptions
- ✅ Real 90-day historical price charts
- ✅ Accurate daily open/high/low/close values
- ✅ Current percentage changes and trends

### When API Access is Partial (Free Tier):
- ✅ Current prices and company info displayed (from free endpoints)
- ⚠️ Warning shown that historical data is unavailable
- ❌ Historical chart hidden (not simulated with fake data)
- ℹ️ User informed about API tier limitations

### When API Access Completely Fails:
- ❌ Clear error message displayed
- ❌ No data shown at all
- ❌ User is informed about the specific issue
- ❌ Application does not proceed with fake data

## Error Messages You May See

### "Historical data not available with your free tier API key"
**Meaning**: Your Finnhub API key doesn't have permission to access historical candle data.  
**Action**: Contact Finnhub support or upgrade your plan.  
**Result**: App will show current prices and company info, but hide historical chart (no simulated data).

### "No historical data available for this symbol"
**Meaning**: The API returned no data for the requested stock symbol.  
**Action**: Verify the symbol is correct and try again.  
**Result**: App will NOT generate fake historical trends.

### "Invalid API key"
**Meaning**: Your API key is incorrect or has been revoked.  
**Action**: Check your key in Settings and verify it's correct on Finnhub.  
**Result**: App will NOT work until a valid key is provided.

### "API rate limit exceeded"
**Meaning**: You've made too many requests too quickly.  
**Action**: Wait 60 seconds and try again.  
**Result**: App will NOT cache or fabricate data during the wait.

## API Requirements

To use TakeStock, your Finnhub API key MUST have access to:

1. **Company Profile Endpoint** (`/stock/profile2`)
   - Provides company information, sector, description
   - Usually included in free tier

2. **Real-Time Quote Endpoint** (`/quote`)
   - Provides current price, daily high/low, changes
   - Usually included in free tier

3. **Historical Candle Endpoint** (`/stock/candle`)
   - Provides 90 days of historical OHLC data
   - **May require upgraded plan or special access**
   - **This is where many free keys face restrictions**

## Why This Matters

### Financial Safety
- **Bad Data = Bad Decisions**: Using simulated data for investment decisions is dangerous
- **False Confidence**: Generated charts look real but have no basis in actual market movements
- **Legal Liability**: Showing fake data as real could have serious legal consequences

### Professional Standards
- **Transparency**: Users must know when data is real vs. simulated
- **Accountability**: We're accountable for the data we display
- **Trust**: Financial tools require absolute trust in data integrity

### Ethical Responsibility
- **Do No Harm**: We won't contribute to poor financial decisions
- **Informed Users**: Clear errors help users understand limitations
- **Proper Tools**: If users need free data, they should use appropriate free tools
