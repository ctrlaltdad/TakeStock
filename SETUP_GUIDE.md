# Quick Setup Guide - Multi-API Real Stock Data

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Real Data Only

**This application displays ONLY real data from financial APIs.** There is no mock, simulated, or generated data. The app uses multiple APIs to provide complete stock information:
- **Finnhub**: Real-time quotes
- **Alpha Vantage**: Historical price data (primary)
- **Polygon.io**: Historical data backup

If APIs fail or lack permissions, you'll see error messages instead of fabricated data. **Never make financial decisions based on unverified data.**

## üí° Understanding API Limits

### Finnhub (Real-time Quotes):
- **60 calls per minute**
- Each stock lookup uses 2 calls (profile + quote)
- You can look up ~30 stocks per minute
- Resets every 60 seconds

### Alpha Vantage (Historical Data):
- **25 calls per day** (free key)
- **500 calls per day** (with free registration)
- Each stock lookup uses 1 call
- Resets at midnight UTC

### Polygon (Historical Backup):
- **5 calls per minute**
- Each stock lookup uses 1 call
- Data has 15-minute delay
- Resets every 60 seconds

### Smart Usage:
- Look up a stock once, then use business lever simulations (no extra API calls)
- If you hit Alpha Vantage limit, app automatically uses Polygon
- Spread your searches throughout the day for Alpha Vantage

### Best Practices:
1. Keep your API key private (don't share screenshots with your key visible)
2. The key is stored locally in your browser (localStorage)
3. You only need to enter it once - it will persist
4. Click "Clear Key" in settings if you want to remove it

## üîç Testing Real Data

To verify you're getting real data:

1. Look up **PEP** (PepsiCo)
2. Check the price - it should be around $170-180 (current market price)
3. The historical chart should show realistic price movements
4. Company description should read: "PepsiCo, Inc. operates as a food and beverage company worldwide..."

Compare with:
- [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PEP)
- [Google Finance](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/PEP:NASDAQ)

The prices should match!

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

### "Please add your Finnhub API key"
- You haven't configured an API key yet
- Click ‚öôÔ∏è Settings and add your key

### "Invalid API key"
- Double-check you copied the entire key
- Make sure there are no extra spaces
- Try generating a new key on Finnhub

### "API rate limit exceeded"
- You've made more than 60 calls in a minute
- Wait 60 seconds and try again
- This is rare unless you're rapidly clicking

### Data looks wrong
- Some stocks may not have complete data on Finnhub
- Try major stocks like AAPL, MSFT, TSLA, PEP
- Check if the symbol is correct (must be exact)

### "Historical data endpoint forbidden" or 403 Error
- Your Finnhub API key does not have access to historical candle data
- **The app will NOT show simulated data** - you'll see this error message
- **Solution**: Contact Finnhub support to request historical data access, or upgrade your plan
- **DO NOT use the app for financial decisions** if you cannot access complete real data

## üÜò Still Need Help?

1. Check the browser console (F12) for error messages
2. Verify your API key is still valid on Finnhub dashboard
3. Try a different stock symbol
4. Make sure you have internet connection
